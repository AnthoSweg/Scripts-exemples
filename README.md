# Scripts-exemples
Some scripts from a project I worked on for 6 months.

A couch game where 4 players try to be the best burglar by stealing furnitures from a house and placing them in their van.
Each furniture as a random price based on it's size and value, so you have to choose between stealing near furnitures that are cheap or going for the long road and risking getting robbed by a friend.
